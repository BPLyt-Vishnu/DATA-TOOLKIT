        "Broadcasting lets NumPy perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes, without the need to make them have the same shape initially. It does this by \"stretching\" the smaller array along dimensions where needed. For example, adding a scalar to a NumPy array is an example of broadcasting."
